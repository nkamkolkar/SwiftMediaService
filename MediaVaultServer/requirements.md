# Swift Media Storage and Streaming Service
## Detailed Requirements Document
### 1. System Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a media storage and streaming service implemented in Swift. The system will allow users to upload, store, and stream video files and photographs via an OpenAPI client.

### 2. Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 Media Upload
- The system shall provide API endpoints for uploading one or more video files and photographs
- The API shall conform to the OpenAPI specification
- The system shall validate incoming files for:
  - Acceptable file types (common video formats: MP4, MOV, AVI; common image formats: JPEG, PNG, HEIC)
  - File size limits (configurable, initial setting of 100MB for videos, 20MB for images)
  - Malware/virus scanning (placeholder for future implementation)

#### 2.2 Storage Management
- The system shall save uploaded files to local storage
- Files shall be organized in a folder structure based on capture date:
  - Root directory: configurable base path
  - Sub-directories: /YEAR/MONTH/DAY/
  - Filenames shall be unique, using a combination of:
    - Original filename (sanitized)
    - Timestamp
    - Random UUID
- The system shall extract metadata from files when available to determine capture date
- If capture date is not available, the system shall use the upload date

#### 2.3 Media Streaming
- The system shall provide API endpoints for retrieving stored media
- Support for retrieving individual files by ID or path
- Support for listing files with filtering options (date range, file type)
- Support for streaming video content with appropriate headers
- Support for retrieving images with optional resizing parameters

#### 2.4 Security
- All API endpoints shall be secured via HTTPS
- The system shall implement basic authentication for the prototype
- The system shall validate all input to prevent injection attacks
- The system shall implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

#### 2.5 Cross-platform Support
- The backend shall run as a service on:
  - macOS (10.15+)
  - Ubuntu (20.04 LTS+)
- The system shall use Swift libraries compatible with both platforms

### 3. Non-functional Requirements

#### 3.1 Performance
- The system shall handle concurrent uploads (minimum 10 simultaneous uploads)
- The system shall support streaming to multiple clients (minimum 20 simultaneous streams)
- Upload confirmation response time shall be under 2 seconds for files under 50MB

#### 3.2 Scalability Considerations
- The prototype will focus on functionality over scalability
- Code shall include comments indicating areas for future scalability improvements
- The design shall allow for future migration to distributed storage

#### 3.3 Reliability
- The system shall handle errors gracefully
- The system shall log all operations and errors
- The system shall recover from crashes without data loss

#### 3.4 Maintainability
- Code shall follow Swift best practices and style guidelines
- Documentation shall be provided for all public APIs
- The system shall use a modular design for easier maintenance

### 4. Constraints and Assumptions

#### 4.1 Development Constraints
- The prototype must be completed within one week
- The system must be implemented in Swift
- Third-party libraries may be used but must be open-source and well-maintained

#### 4.2 Assumptions
- Local storage is sufficient for the prototype
- Network bandwidth is adequate for the expected load
- The system will run on dedicated hardware
